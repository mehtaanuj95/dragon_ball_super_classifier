# Dragon Ball Super Character Classifier

This project aims to create a classifier using Fast AI Library (with use of Convolution neural network) to clasify different characters of the popular anime dragon ball super.

The accuracy acheived using this classifeir was **91%**.

The images for different characters were obtained from google images. Theier url's are available in dataset folder.

**Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** was used in this classifier. In CNN, the architecture used was **resnet34**.
It was trained on Python Google Compute Engine Beckend. The code implementation can be found in the jupyter notebook.

The list of Characters that can be classified are: 
```goku, jiren, hit, vegeta, zenoh, whis, beerus, gohan, piccolo```.
